## Parallelism and concurrency
Parallelism and concurrency are two sharp swords that could improve the transaction execution performance of Blockchain and Blockchain-related VMs(i.e., EVM and SVM). 

This knowledge base collects information about state-of-the-art research and engineering works about parallel and concurrent blockchain, blockchain VM, and other related systems, with some relevant examples for better understanding.
